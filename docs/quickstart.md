# Quickstart

Zero to a working agent in **under five minutes**. Work the checklist top to
bottom — every step says what success looks like, and where to look if you
don't see it:

> ☐ installed → ☐ `--setup` all green → ☐ first conversation → ☐ first
> coding one-shot → ☐ Forge on a repo → ☐ *(optional)* Telegram

## ☐ 1. Install (2 min)

The fastest path is the prebuilt binary — SHA256-verified, no Rust toolchain
needed (that's also what the [README](../README.md#get-started-in-2-minutes)
leads with):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdushidush/claudette/main/install.sh | sh   # Linux / macOS
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdushidush/claudette/main/install.ps1 | iex  # Windows (PowerShell)
```

Have a Rust toolchain and prefer it? `cargo install claudette` builds the same
lean binary.

Then the model server and the default brain:

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com (one-time), then:
ollama serve &
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b     # ~3.4 GB on disk, ~3.4 GB VRAM — runs on plain CPU too
```

**You should see:** the installer end with `installed vX.Y.Z (lean) → …` and a
`next: claudette --setup` hint; `ollama pull` reach 100%.
**If `claudette` isn't found in a new terminal:**
[troubleshooting → command not found](troubleshooting.md#claudette-command-not-found-after-install).

The `qwen3.5:4b` brain handles every tool-using flow on its own. Prefer LM
Studio or a bigger model? See [configuration.md](configuration.md) and
[hardware.md](hardware.md).

> **Integrations are opt-in.** The default install is a lean, air-gapped
> coding agent with **no cloud code**. The Telegram bot, Gmail, Google
> Calendar, and the voice / morning-briefing helpers ship in the **full**
> flavor — grab it prebuilt with
> `CLAUDETTE_FLAVOR=full curl -fsSL …/install.sh | sh`
> (Windows: `$env:CLAUDETTE_FLAVOR='full'; iwr -useb …/install.ps1 | iex`),
> or build it with `cargo install claudette --features integrations`. The
> `--telegram`, `--auth-google`, and `--briefing` flows below all need it; the
> lean build prints those exact install commands if you try one.

## ☐ 2. Guided setup → all green (1 min)

```bash
claudette --setup
```

`--setup` is the one-time wizard: it detects your backend (Ollama / LM Studio)
and GPU VRAM, offers to pull the brain that fits your card, points at the
integrations setup, and finishes by running the full `--doctor` report. It
needs a real terminal, and it refuses under `--offline`.

Already set up, or just want the check? `claudette --doctor` runs the report on
its own, any time something misbehaves:

```bash
claudette --doctor
```

`--doctor` probes every dependency and prints a green/red report with a
**copy-paste `↳ fix:` command** under anything that's broken — model server not
running, brain not pulled, a missing build toolchain (`git` / `cargo` /
`python` / `node` / `go`), or absent voice deps. Run it any time something
misbehaves.

It also **recommends a Claudette-Certified model for your GPU**: the "pick a
brain" section detects VRAM via `nvidia-smi` (falling back to
`CLAUDETTE_VRAM_GB`) and maps it to the best measured brain for that tier,
with the exact load command. Advisory only — nothing is switched for you.

And if the first interactive run finds the brain missing, claudette **offers
to pull it on the spot** (`[Y/n]` → `ollama pull …` with live progress) instead
of dead-ending. Piped/CI/`--offline` runs keep the old print-and-exit behaviour.

**You should see:** green "local brain" and "build toolchains" rows.
**If a row is red:** run the `↳ fix:` command printed right under it, then
re-run `--doctor`. Still stuck →
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

## ☐ 3. First conversation (30 sec)

```bash
claudette "what time is it?"
```

**You should see:** a correct answer within a few seconds — except the very
first prompt after a model load, which can hang 1–3 minutes while the model
loads into memory. That's normal:
[troubleshooting → first-prompt hang](troubleshooting.md#the-first-prompt-hangs-for-13-minutes-then-answers).

## ☐ 4. First coding one-shot (1 min)

```bash
cd ~/code/any-project
claudette "map this repo and explain the module layout in five bullets"
```

**You should see:** tool calls stream past (`repo_map`, `read_file`, …), then a
grounded summary of *your actual code* — not generic filler. That's the coding
core (files, search, tests) working; it's pre-enabled in any repo.

## ☐ 5. Forge on a repo (5–10 min)

Forge is the autonomous Planner → Coder → Verifier pipeline — the build/test
gate means a diff that doesn't compile or breaks a test can't pass. Follow the
copy-paste recipe in
[first-success.md#coding](first-success.md#coding), or the full walkthrough
[below](#forge-hands-off-code-changes-with-a-review-gate).

**You should see:** phases stream (`forge: planner` → `coder` → `build + test`
→ `verifier … pass=true`), ending in a verified commit on an isolated
`claudette-mission/*` branch (local repo) or a `[y/N]` review gate before a PR
(GitHub repo).

## ☐ 6. *(Optional)* Telegram from your phone

Needs the **full** flavor from step 1's integrations note. Three commands:
[first-success.md#assistant](first-success.md#assistant).

**You should see:** your bot reply to a text from your phone, and transcribe a
voice note.

---

Four entry points, one runtime, one session format — switching is just a
different command:

```bash
claudette                            # interactive REPL
claudette --tui                      # fullscreen TUI
claudette "your prompt here"         # one-shot, prints reply and exits
claudette --telegram --chat any      # Telegram bot (needs --features integrations)
claudette --resume                   # resume last session
claudette --offline "..."            # enforced air-gap: block all cloud egress
```

Add `--offline` (or set `CLAUDETTE_OFFLINE=1`) to any of these to **enforce**
the air-gap — every outbound call except the local model backend + loopback is
hard-blocked, so the brain and recall keep working but web search, mail, GitHub,
Telegram, and remote git all refuse. `claudette --offline --doctor` prints the
exact allow-list. See [Air-gapped, and enforced](../README.md#-air-gapped-and-enforced).

## The TUI in 60 seconds

```bash
claudette --tui
```

Five tabs across the top — switch with number keys or cycle with `Tab` /
`Shift+Tab`:

| Key | Tab | What's there |
|-----|-----|--------------|
| `1` | **Chat** | Streaming conversation + inline tool calls |
| `2` | **Tools** | Full tool-event log (every call, args, result) |
| `3` | **Notes** | Browse `~/.claudette/notes/` — `↑`/`↓` select, `f` filter by tag |
| `4` | **Todos** | `↑`/`↓` select, `Space`/`Enter` toggle done |
| `5` | **HW** | Live GPU / VRAM / temperature |

- **Type and press `Enter`** to send (number keys only switch tabs when the
  input box is empty, so you can still type "1pm").
- **Slash commands work here too** — `/help`, `/brownfield`, `/forge`, `/recall`,
  everything the REPL has.
- **`Ctrl+V`** pastes an image or text block into your next message.
- **`Ctrl+C`** (or `Ctrl+D`) quits.

## Forge: hands-off code changes with a review gate

Forge runs an autonomous **Planner → Coder → Verifier → fix-loop → Submitter**
pipeline against a git repo. It builds, tests, and ends by opening a PR — and it
asks for your sign-off before the PR goes out.

### Against a GitHub repo (review gate → PR)

```
> /brownfield owner/some-repo
> /forge make the --timeout flag accept fractional seconds
```

`/brownfield` clones into `~/.claudette/missions/<slug>/` and re-routes file ops
into the clone. `/forge` runs the pipeline; watch the phases stream past:

```text
forge: planner                 # localizes the code, writes a short plan
forge: coder (round 0)         # makes the edit, commits to the mission branch
forge: build + test            # cargo check / cargo test (py/js/go too)
forge: verifier   score=9 pass=true
forge: review — approve before opening the PR
  ── plan ──
  ...
  ── diff ──
  ...
  ⚠ Open the PR with these changes? [y/N]
```

Two things make this trustworthy:

1. **The Verifier actually builds and tests.** Each round it runs the project's
   real build + test suite in the tree (`cargo check`/`cargo test`,
   `go build`/`go test`, `pytest`, `npm test`). A diff that doesn't compile or
   breaks a test can't pass — the failures are fed back to the Coder to fix.
2. **You QA before the PR ships.** The review gate prints the plan + the full
   final diff and waits for an explicit `y`. Anything else (including a piped,
   non-interactive stdin) leaves the commits on the mission branch and opens no
   PR — re-run `/forge` to continue, or push manually.

### Against a local repo (commits to a branch, no PR)

```bash
cd ~/code/your-project          # any git repo under $HOME
claudette --forge "make the --timeout flag accept fractional seconds"
```

Inside an existing repo with no active mission, Forge auto-bootstraps an
ephemeral mission at the repo root — no clone, no setup. It runs the same
build-and-test-verified pipeline, then **commits the result to an isolated
`claudette-mission/*` branch** and restores your working branch untouched. There
is no PR (and so no review gate) for a local mission — review the branch with
`git log` / `git diff`, then `git merge` or `git branch -D` as you see fit.

Useful knobs (all optional):

| Env var | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `CLAUDETTE_FORGE_NO_REVIEW=1` | Skip the human-review gate (fully hands-off PR) |
| `CLAUDETTE_FORGE_NO_BUILD_CHECK=1` | Skip the build+test gate (slow/networked suites) |
| `CLAUDETTE_FORGE_TEST_TIMEOUT_SECS=300` | Per-step build/test timeout (default 180) |
| `CLAUDETTE_FORGE_AUTO_APPROVE=1` | Unattended: auto-approve tool calls **and** skip the review gate |
